## Foundational taxonomic resources for the TPT project

This repository is meant to facilitate access to taxonomic resources produced by the Terrestrial Parasite Tracker project. These resources were compiled from various experts and organizations and cleaned. This process is iterative and should not be considered "final". However, these resources constitute the most up-to-date view of these resources at the time of upload. Improvements to these resources will be reflected here until further notice.
